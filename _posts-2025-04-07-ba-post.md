**Abstract**

The present bachelor thesis examines the manner in which political news posts on Instagram are received and processed. Instagram is a platform that increasingly combines both entertaining and journalistic-informative content. The objective of the present study was to ascertain the extent to which the thematic context – that is to say, the embedding of news posts in an entertainment context – influences the cognitive processing of this content. The theoretical framework for this study was established on the basis of the limited capacity model (Lang, 2000) and the concept of "incidental news exposure" (IE) (Tewksbury et al. (2001). The experimental design involved the comparison of two groups: The experimental group was exposed to news posts in a simulated, entertainment-based Instagram feed, while the control group was presented with the same content in a purely news context. The experimental results demonstrated that political posts within an entertainment context were processed significantly more superficially and remembered less well. The study also revealed that, irrespective of the context, the general level of attention during reception was found to be minimal, thereby underscoring the predominant utilisation motivation of "entertainment". Conversely, the study revealed that the depth of processing was positively influenced by the subjective relevance of the topic. The study thus provides relevant findings on the impact of journalistic content on social platforms and points to the challenges that news providers face in the digital space, where the context in which a piece of news appears cannot be controlled.
